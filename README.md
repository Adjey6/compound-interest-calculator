# Advanced Compound Interest Calculator with AI Analysis ‚ú®
This project is an interactive compound interest calculator that allows you to visualize the growth of your investments in index funds over time. It goes a step further by integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) functionality powered by Gemini, offering you personalized analyses and insights into your investment strategy. Additionally, you can now simulate unique additional contributions in specific months to see their impact.

## üöÄ Key Features
Compound Interest Simulation: Calculates the growth of your capital based on initial investment, monthly contributions, annual return, and time horizon.

Unique Additional Contributions: Add extra amounts at specific months and years to observe how they accelerate your growth.

Clear Visualization:

Projection Chart: An intuitive line chart showing the evolution of your capital year by year.

Monthly Detail Table: A comprehensive table with a month-by-month breakdown of capital at the start, contributions (monthly and additional), interest generated, and final capital.

Investment Analysis with AI (Gemini API) ‚ú®:

Ask questions about your investment plan and receive answers generated by an advanced language model.

Gain insights into the feasibility of your goals or the impact of your investment parameters.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
React: For building the interactive and dynamic user interface.

recharts: For creating attractive and responsive data charts.

Tailwind CSS: For fast, modern, and fully responsive design.

Google Gemini API: For AI-powered analysis and assistance functionality.

## üí° How It Works?
Enter Your Parameters: Fill in the "Initial Investment," "Monthly Contribution," "Annual Return (%)," and "Time Horizon (Years)" fields.

Add Additional Contributions: If desired, specify a year, month, and an extra amount to add to your investment. You can add multiple additional contributions.

Visualize Results: Observe how the chart and projection table update in real-time to demonstrate the power of compound interest.

Consult the AI: In the "Investment Analysis and Additional Contributions" section, type a question about your plan (e.g., "Is this a good plan for retirement?", "How realistic is my goal of ‚Ç¨500,000?") and click "Ask Gemini ‚ú®" to get an intelligent response.

## üöÄ Getting Started (Local Development)
If you want to run this project on your local machine:

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/compound-interest-calculator.git
cd compound-interest-calculator

(Replace YOUR_USERNAME and compound-interest-calculator with your actual repository details if you upload it to GitHub.)

Install dependencies:

npm install
# or
yarn install

Configure your Gemini API Key:

You will need an API Key for the Google Gemini API.

Create a .env file in the project root and add your key:

VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE

(Note: The code in the "Immersive Document" I provided does not explicitly need a key in the code as it is injected in that environment. For local development, you will need it).

Start the application:

npm run dev
# or
yarn dev

The application will open in your browser at http://localhost:5173 (or a similar port).
